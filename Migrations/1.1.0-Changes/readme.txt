Welcome to your SQL Change Automation project.

This folder has automatically been created for migration scripts. You may choose to rename this folder if you prefer, and you may also create subfolders in it.

To learn more about your options for folder structure, migration script names, and deployment order, please visit: 
https://documentation.red-gate.com/sca/developing-databases/concepts/migrations/migration-scripts

For Git users, we recommend that you keep this file in place until you generate one or more migrations scripts in this folder, or in a subfolder. Git does not recognize empty folders, so this file will maintain the folder structure of your project if you share it with others immediately after creation.
